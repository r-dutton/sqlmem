SqlMemoryAnalyzer only inspects the first SQL Server process, missing additional instances for diagnostics.
Resolved by iterating through all SQL Server processes when generating findings so each instance is evaluated.
SqlMemInspector driver does not report the required buffer size when IOCTL_SQLMEM_GET_SUMMARY fails, leaving callers without guidance on how large a buffer to provide.
SqlMemInspector reports HasLockPagesPrivilege when the privilege is merely enabled-by-default but currently disabled, overstating which processes can lock pages.
Resolved by counting processes before populating the summary, using safe size math, and returning the exact bytes required when the caller's buffer is insufficient.
Resolved by requiring SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED before marking HasLockPagesPrivilege so only actively enabled tokens are reported as privileged.
